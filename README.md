## 1. Description
This app gives weather information over 6 days (current and 5 day forecast) for various cities.

### Note:
I used font-awesome icons instead of the ones that come with the API because I just wanted to be different.

### Summary of Functionality

* You can view weather information for the current day in a popular city of your choosing. This information includes the UV index, current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weahter conditions.
* You can view a weather forecast for the same city. This information includes current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
* The background color for the current day adjusts depending on the time of day in that city.

## 5. Next steps
Several features could be added, some of them are as follows:
- better UI
- use of an API that gives less preference to US cities (the current one shows Melbourne in the US instead of Australia etc.)
